\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Structure of this thesis in terms of the set-up of our framework. (a) Our modelling framework applying Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models to predict commodity demand, land-use models to spatially downscale these demands and biodiversity models to predict biodiversity outcomes. Throughout our framework, scenarios have been parametrized through economic damages and general circulation models (GCM). (b) Thesis chapters in terms of the framework. Chapter 2 provides a first, regional implementation of our integrated assessment framework in which climate change impacts (RCP) are parametrized. Chapter 3 specifies a new fractional land-use model to improve the linkage of macro-economic and biodiversity models. Chapter 4 provides a first global implementation of our framework in which the new land-use model is first applied to spatially downscale SSP and predictions are compared to those made by an existing IAM.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Conceptual diagram of land use modelling approach. (a) Land use suitability model. Observed fractions of land use are first converted to integer counts through multinomial draws and their relationship with environmental drivers and neighbourhood covariates (derived from previous time steps land-use distribution) is assessed. (b) Allocation algorithm. First, it is estimated by how much each cell has to change to achieve the modelled ideal distribution of land uses. Change factors are then converted to relative suitabilities that serve to distribute land use supply required to satisfy the additional demand in the landscape. Multinomial draws ensure that each cells land use class probabilities sum to 1. The resulting difference of the current supply and the total additional demand is recalculated to support allocation in the next iteration. The cycle repeats until the difference between the current supply and total additional demand is very close to zero, meaning that all additional demand has been allocated. At this point, the integer counts representing the land use fractions on each cell are converted back to fractional representation. The new fractions are used to calculate neighbourhood covariates in the next time step.\relax }}{36}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces Validation of predicted land use change intensity and direction of change and cross-validation of suitability model. a) The difference between RMSE for each model (naive, semi-naive, full) and RMSE of the null model. The null model assumes that land use is static through time, the naive model assumes completely random allocations, the semi-naive model assumes that allocations are scaled with land use suitability and the full model assumes that allocations are both scaled with land use suitability and subject to model constraints (no changes in areas under high protection status and no land use increases in areas completely devoid of that land use). All RMSE were calculated at cell-level, using the predicted and observed vectors of land use fractions in each cell. Plotted are means across cells. Positive values indicate better fits under the null model, negative values indicate better fit under more highly parametrised models. Data on validation outcomes are grouped by the magnitude of the largest observed proportional change in any land use within a cell. In general, the larger the observed change in land use, the better the parameterized models did compared with the null model. b) The proportional disagreement between predictions of the cell-level direction of change (no change, decrease, increase) for each land use and the observed direction of change at each time step. Smaller values indicate lower overall difference and higher similarity between corresponding maps. c) Difference between cross-validated RMSE estimated for suitability models containing only environmental covariates and only neighbourhood covariates and models containing both covariate types combined. Positive values indicate a poorer fit than the model containing both covariate types.\relax }}{45}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Diagram illustrating how each model component was applied to compare our predictions with Message 8.5. To make predictions under the SSP1 and SSP5 baseline scenarios (see \Cref {scenarios}), we estimated land-use demand from our CGE model (GTAP INT), downscaled projected land-use demands in our land-use model (FLUTES) and predicted land-use intensity and biodiversity intactness (BII) (dashed line). In Message 8.5 scenarios, we predicted land-use intensity and BII using land-use maps produced under the Message 8.5 model (solid line, M8.5 scenario) and extracting the demands of the Message 8.5 predictions, but downscaling these with FLUTES (dotted line, M8.5 demand).\relax }}{56}%
