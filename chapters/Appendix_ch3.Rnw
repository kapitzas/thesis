The multinomial model we used to estimate and predict land use suitability predicted very small probabilities of occurrence even in areas where a land use was not observed, because we were unable to capture all processes leading to the complete absence of a land use in an area. To capture some of these processes and prevent the unrealistic dispersal of land uses through the landscape (for example tiny fractions of urban land in the middle of forest), we applied a constraint that controlled the allocation of changes in land demand into areas where the land use has historically not occurred, thus ensuring patterns of clustering we also observed in the validation time series. However, it would be similarly unrealistic to prevent the new establishment of a land use type on each cell where the land use was not historically observed. Therefore, we parametrized the constraint by determining for each observed time step how many of the cells in which a land use type was observed were not occupied by that land use type in the preceding time step, expressed as a percentage of cells for each land use type. Since these percentages varied between time steps, we used the long-term average of the percentages (from the entire time series) to estimate the constraint parameter. During the simulation, we only allowed the estimated percentage of cells to go from being completely devoid in a land use to containing that land use in the next time step. This is similar to the elasticity parameter applied in the CLUE model series. The elasticities in CLUE are estimated based on expert knowledge or survey data and control the amount of shifting through the landscape a land use can experience between time steps without net changes to the overall amount of land under the land use type \citep{verburg_modeling_2002}. Our constraint controls shifting of a land use into cells completely devoid of that land use, but it does not control the shifting of land between cells that both contain the land use. As long as demand for a land use at the study area level prescribes changes in supply and a land use is allowed to decrease in any given area (we did not allow reductions in urban land to reflect the high initial investment), such shifts between cells already occupied by the land use are allowed.
